# Multilabel-Classification-task-using-the-KNeighborsClassifier
### Setting Up Project Structure

Before diving into the code, let's ensure everything is set up correctly:

- **Project Root Directory**: `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` serves as the heart of our project, housing all our files and code.
- **Chapter Identifier**: `CHAPTER_ID` keeps our project organized by identifying each chapter or section.
- **Images Path**: `IMAGES_PATH` is where all the visualizations and figures will be saved.

### Creating a Stable Environment

We believe in stable and reproducible results. Here's what we do:

- **Version Compatibility**: We ensure compatibility with Python 3.5 and above.
- **Dependency Check**: We require Scikit-Learn version 0.20 or higher for our machine learning tasks.
- **Random Seed**: Setting the random seed to 42 ensures consistent results across different runs.

### Beautiful Visualizations

Visuals matter! We make sure our figures are not just informative but also visually appealing:

- **Matplotlib Magic**: With `%matplotlib inline`, we seamlessly integrate our plots into the notebook.
- **Custom Styling**: We tweak Matplotlib's settings to ensure our plots look polished and professional.
- **Image Saving**: Our `save_fig` function automates the process of saving figures, maintaining quality and organization.

Now, let's dive into the code and see our project come to life!

print("Shape of the target labels (y):", y.shape)
```

This code snippet will print the shape of the target labels (y) of the MNIST dataset. It helps users understand the dimensions of the target variable in the dataset.


```python
# Calculating the dimension of each image in the MNIST dataset
image_dimension = 28 * 28
print("Dimension of each image in the MNIST dataset:", image_dimension)
```

```python
# Displaying an example digit from the MNIST dataset
some_digit = X[0]
some_digit_image = some_digit.reshape(28, 28)
plt.imshow(some_digit_image, cmap=mpl.cm.binary)
plt.axis("off")

    n_rows = (len(instances) - 1) // images_per_row + 1

    # Padding the instances array to create a complete grid
    n_empty = n_rows * images_per_row - len(instances)
    padded_instances = np.concatenate([instances, np.zeros((n_empty, size * size))], axis=0)

    # Reshaping the padded instances into a grid
    image_grid = padded_instances.reshape((n_rows, images_per_row, size, size))

    # Combining axes to create a big image

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a figure with a specified size, select example images from the MNIST dataset, plot them in a grid layout using the `plot_digits` function, save the plot as an image file, and then display the plot.


```python
# Accessing the target label of the first sample in the MNIST dataset
first_target_label = y[0]
print("Target label of the first sample in the MNIST dataset:", first_target_label)
```

This code fetches and prints the target label of the first sample in the MNIST dataset. You can use it to show the label associated with the example digit displayed in the previous code snippet.


```python
# Splitting the MNIST dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[:60000], X[60000:], y[:60000], y[60000:]
```

This code splits the MNIST dataset into training and testing sets, where the first 60,000 samples are used for training (`X_train` and `y_train`), and the remaining samples are used for testing (`X_test` and `y_test`). 


```python
# Creating binary classification labels for '5' detection in the training and testing sets
y_train_5 = (y_train == 5)
y_test_5 = (y_test == 5)
```

This code creates binary classification labels for detecting the digit '5' in both the training and testing sets. The `y_train_5` array contains `True` values where the corresponding label in `y_train` is '5', and `False` otherwise. Similarly, the `y_test_5` array contains `True` values where the corresponding label in `y_test` is '5', and `False` otherwise. 


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

# Instantiating and training a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier for binary classification
sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, random_state=42)
sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_5)
```

This code creates a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier object with specified hyperparameters (`max_iter`, `tol`, and `random_state`) and then fits it to the training data (`X_train` and `y_train_5`).

```python
# Making predictions using the trained SGD classifier
prediction = sgd_clf.predict([some_digit])
print("Predicted class for the example digit:", prediction)
```

This code predicts the class of the example digit using the trained SGD classifier (`sgd_clf`) and prints the predicted class. 


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Performing cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the SGD classifier
cv_scores = cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring="accuracy")
print("Cross-validation scores:", cv_scores)
```

This code snippet utilizes cross-validation to assess the performance of the SGD classifier (`sgd_clf`) on the training data (`X_train` and `y_train_5`) using 3-fold cross-validation, with accuracy as the evaluation metric. The output consists of an array containing the accuracy scores obtained from each fold of cross-validation. 


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.base import clone

# Creating a StratifiedKFold object with 3 folds for stratified cross-validation
skfolds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Iterating over the folds and performing cross-validation
for train_index, test_index in skfolds.split(X_train, y_train_5):
    # Cloning the SGD classifier to ensure a clean slate for each fold
    clone_clf = clone(sgd_clf)
    
    # Obtaining the training and testing data for the current fold
    X_train_fold = X_train[train_index]
    y_train_fold = y_train_5[train_index]
    X_test_fold = X_train[test_index]
    y_test_fold = y_train_5[test_index]

    # Training the cloned classifier on the training data for the current fold
    clone_clf.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)
    
    # Making predictions on the testing data for the current fold
    y_pred = clone_clf.predict(X_test_fold)
    
    # Calculating and printing the accuracy of the predictions for the current fold
    accuracy = sum(y_pred == y_test_fold) / len(y_pred)
    print("Accuracy for the fold:", accuracy)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to perform stratified cross-validation using the StratifiedKFold class. It iterates over the folds, trains a clone of the SGD classifier on the training data for each fold, makes predictions on the testing data, and calculates the accuracy of the predictions for each fold.


```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator

class Never5Classifier(BaseEstimator):
    """A classifier that always predicts that a digit is not '5'."""

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        """Fitting method of the classifier."""
        pass

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Prediction method of the classifier.

        Parameters:
        - X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The input data for which predictions are to be made.

        Returns:
        - predictions : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            An array of boolean values indicating whether each sample is predicted as '5' (False) or not '5' (True).
        """
        # Always predicting that the digit is not '5' (returning an array of zeros)
        return np.zeros((len(X), 1), dtype=bool)
```

This code snippet defines a custom classifier `Never5Classifier` that inherits from scikit-learn's `BaseEstimator` class. This classifier always predicts that a digit is not '5'. The `fit` method does nothing, and the `predict` method returns an array of zeros, indicating that none of the samples are predicted as '5'. 


```python
# Creating an instance of the Never5Classifier
never_5_clf = Never5Classifier()

# Performing cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the Never5Classifier
scores = cross_val_score(never_5_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring="accuracy")
print("Cross-validation scores:", scores)
```

This code creates an instance of the `Never5Classifier` and then performs cross-validation to evaluate its performance on the training data (`X_train` and `y_train_5`) using 3-fold cross-validation with accuracy as the scoring metric. It prints the array of cross-validation scores. 


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict

# Performing cross-validation predictions using the SGD classifier
y_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3)
```

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Generating the confusion matrix for the binary classification task
cm = confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_pred)
print("Confusion matrix:")
print(cm)
```

This code calculates the confusion matrix for the binary classification task between the true labels (`y_train_5`) and the predicted labels (`y_train_pred`). The resulting confusion matrix is stored in the variable `cm`.


```python
# Assuming perfect predictions for the training data
y_train_perfect_predictions = y_train_5

# Generating the confusion matrix for perfect predictions
perfect_cm = confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_perfect_predictions)
print("Confusion matrix for perfect predictions:")
print(perfect_cm)
```

This code snippet creates a hypothetical scenario where perfect predictions are assumed for the training data (`y_train_perfect_predictions`). Then, it calculates the confusion matrix for this perfect prediction scenario. The resulting confusion matrix is stored in the variable `perfect_cm`. 


```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

# Calculating the precision score for the predictions
precision = precision_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred)
print("Precision score:", precision)
```

This code calculates the precision score for the binary classification task between the true labels (`y_train_5`) and the predicted labels (`y_train_pred`). The resulting precision score is stored in the variable `precision`. 


```python
# Retrieving the true positive rate (TPR) or recall from the confusion matrix
true_positive_rate = cm[1, 1] / (cm[0, 1] + cm[1, 1])
print("True Positive Rate (Recall):", true_positive_rate)
```

This code snippet calculates the True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall from the confusion matrix `cm`. It computes the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of false negative predictions (positive instances incorrectly predicted as negative) and true positive predictions. The resulting True Positive Rate (Recall) is printed. 


```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

# Calculating the recall score for the predictions
recall = recall_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred)
print("Recall score:", recall)
```

This code calculates the recall score for the binary classification task between the true labels (`y_train_5`) and the predicted labels (`y_train_pred`). The resulting recall score is printed. 

```python
# Retrieving the precision from the confusion matrix
precision = cm[1, 1] / (cm[1, 0] + cm[1, 1])
print("Precision:", precision)
```

This code calculates the Precision from the confusion matrix `cm`. It computes the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of false positive predictions (negative instances incorrectly predicted as positive) and true positive predictions. The resulting Precision is printed. 



```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Calculating the F1 score for the predictions
f1 = f1_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred)
print("F1 score:", f1)
```

This code calculates the F1 score for the binary classification task between the true labels (`y_train_5`) and the predicted labels (`y_train_pred`). The resulting F1 score is printed.


```python
# Calculating the F1 score manually from the confusion matrix
f1_manual = cm[1, 1] / (cm[1, 1] + (cm[1, 0] + cm[0, 1]) / 2)
print("F1 score (manual calculation):", f1_manual)
```

This code calculates the F1 score manually using the values from the confusion matrix `cm`. It computes the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false positive predictions, and recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false negative predictions. The resulting F1 score is printed. You can include this code in your README to demonstrate how to calculate the F1 score manually from a confusion matrix.


```python
# Calculating decision scores for a sample using the trained SGDClassifier
y_scores = sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit])
print("Decision scores:", y_scores)
```

This code snippet calculates the decision scores for a single sample (`some_digit`) using the trained SGDClassifier `sgd_clf`. The resulting decision scores are printed. 


```python
# Applying a threshold to decision scores to make predictions
threshold = 0
y_some_digit_pred = (y_scores > threshold)
print("Predicted class using threshold {}: {}".format(threshold, y_some_digit_pred))
```

This code applies a threshold of 0 to the decision scores `y_scores` to make binary predictions for a single sample. The resulting predicted class is printed. 

```python
# Printing the predicted class based on the decision scores and threshold
print("Predicted class:", y_some_digit_pred)
```

This code simply prints the predicted class obtained from applying a threshold to the decision scores. 


```python
# Applying a different threshold to decision scores to make predictions
threshold = 8000
y_some_digit_pred = (y_scores > threshold)
print("Predicted class using threshold {}: {}".format(threshold, y_some_digit_pred))
```

This code sets a different threshold of 8000 to the decision scores `y_scores` and makes binary predictions for a single sample. The resulting predicted class is printed. 


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict

# Using cross-validation to obtain decision scores for each sample
y_scores = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, method="decision_function")
print("Decision scores shape:", y_scores.shape)
```

This code uses cross-validation to obtain decision scores for each sample in the training set using the `cross_val_predict` function with the method parameter set to "decision_function". The resulting decision scores are printed. 


```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve

# Calculating precision, recall, and thresholds using precision_recall_curve
precisions, recalls, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_train_5, y_scores)
print("Number of thresholds:", len(thresholds))

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_precision_recall_vs_threshold(precisions, recalls, thresholds):
    # Plotting precision and recall against thresholds
    plt.plot(thresholds, precisions[:-1], "b--", label="Precision", linewidth=2)
    plt.plot(thresholds, recalls[:-1], "g-", label="Recall", linewidth=2)
    plt.legend(loc="center right", fontsize=16)
    plt.xlabel("Threshold", fontsize=16)
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.axis([-50000, 50000, 0, 1])

# Obtaining recall at 90% precision and corresponding threshold
recall_90_precision = recalls[np.argmax(precisions >= 0.90)]
threshold_90_precision = thresholds[np.argmax(precisions >= 0.90)]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plot_precision_recall_vs_threshold(precisions, recalls, thresholds)
plt.plot([threshold_90_precision, threshold_90_precision], [0., 0.9], "r:")
plt.plot([-50000, threshold_90_precision], [0.9, 0.9], "r:")
plt.plot([-50000, threshold_90_precision], [recall_90_precision, recall_90_precision], "r:")
plt.plot([threshold_90_precision], [0.9], "ro")
plt.plot([threshold_90_precision], [recall_90_precision], "ro")
plt.title("Precision-Recall vs Threshold Plot")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code defines a function `plot_precision_recall_vs_threshold` to plot precision and recall against different thresholds. It also marks the threshold corresponding to 90% precision and plots it on the graph. Include this code in your README to demonstrate how to visualize precision-recall versus threshold.


```python
# Checking if all predicted values match the condition (y_scores > 0)
(y_train_pred == (y_scores > 0)).all()
```

This line of code verifies whether all predicted values match the condition where the decision function scores are greater than 0. Include this line in your README to demonstrate how to check if all predicted values satisfy a specific condition based on decision function scores.

```python
def plot_precision_vs_recall(precisions, recalls):
    plt.plot(recalls, precisions, "b-", linewidth=2)
    plt.xlabel("Recall", fontsize=16)
    plt.ylabel("Precision", fontsize=16)
    plt.axis([0, 1, 0, 1])
    plt.grid(True)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plot_precision_vs_recall(precisions, recalls)
plt.plot([recall_90_precision, recall_90_precision], [0., 0.9], "r:")
plt.plot([0.0, recall_90_precision], [0.9, 0.9], "r:")
plt.plot([recall_90_precision], [0.9], "ro")
save_fig("precision_vs_recall_plot")
plt.show()
```

This code defines a function `plot_precision_vs_recall` to plot precision versus recall, and then creates a figure using this function along with additional annotations for a specific recall threshold.

```python
threshold_90_precision = thresholds[np.argmax(precisions >= 0.90)]
print("Threshold for 90% precision:", threshold_90_precision)
```

This code calculates the threshold value that corresponds to a precision of 90% and prints it out. 


To calculate the precision and recall scores for predictions based on the threshold corresponding to 90% precision, you can use the following code in your README:

```python
y_train_pred_90 = (y_scores >= threshold_90_precision)
precision_90 = precision_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_90)
recall_90 = recall_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_90)
print("Precision at 90% threshold:", precision_90)
print("Recall at 90% threshold:", recall_90)
```

This code will compute and print the precision and recall scores based on predictions using the threshold value that corresponds to achieving 90% precision. It provides insights into the performance of the model at this specific threshold.

To compute the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for your binary classifier, you can utilize the `roc_curve` function from scikit-learn. Below is the code snippet for computing the ROC curve:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve

fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_train_5, y_scores)
```

This code calculates the false positive rate (fpr), true positive rate (tpr), and thresholds for the ROC curve based on the true labels (`y_train_5`) and the decision scores (`y_scores`) obtained from your classifier.

To visualize the ROC curve, you can use the `plot_roc_curve` function, which plots the false positive rate (x-axis) against the true positive rate (y-axis). Here's how you can implement it:

```python
def plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr, label=None):
    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, linewidth=2, label=label)
    plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--') # dashed diagonal
    plt.axis([0, 1, 0, 1])
    plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate (Fall-Out)', fontsize=16)
    plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate (Recall)', fontsize=16)
    plt.grid(True)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr)
fpr_90 = fpr[np.argmax(tpr >= recall_90_precision)]
plt.plot([fpr_90, fpr_90], [0., recall_90_precision], "r:")
plt.plot([0.0, fpr_90], [recall_90_precision, recall_90_precision], "r:")
plt.plot([fpr_90], [recall_90_precision], "ro")
save_fig("roc_curve_plot")
plt.show()
```

This code snippet defines a function `plot_roc_curve` to plot the ROC curve with custom labels and styling. Then, it creates a figure and calls the function to plot the ROC curve using the false positive rate (`fpr`) and true positive rate (`tpr`) computed earlier. Additionally, it highlights the point corresponding to a 90% recall rate.

The ROC AUC score is a measure of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. You can calculate it using the `roc_auc_score` function from `sklearn.metrics`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_train_5, y_scores)
```

This will compute the ROC AUC score for your binary classifier, where `y_train_5` is the true labels and `y_scores` are the decision scores (e.g., the output of `decision_function`).

Using a `RandomForestClassifier`, you can get the class probabilities instead of decision scores. You can use the `predict_proba` method for this. Here's how you can do it with cross-validation:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict

forest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
y_probas_forest = cross_val_predict(forest_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, method="predict_proba")
```

This will give you an array containing the probability estimates for each class, where each row corresponds to an instance and each column corresponds to a class.

Once you have obtained the class probabilities from the random forest classifier, you can extract the scores for the positive class (class 1) and compute the ROC curve. Here's how you can do it:

```python
y_scores_forest = y_probas_forest[:, 1]  # Score = probability of positive class
fpr_forest, tpr_forest, thresholds_forest = roc_curve(y_train_5, y_scores_forest)
```

This will give you the false positive rate (`fpr_forest`), true positive rate (`tpr_forest`), and thresholds for the random forest classifier.

To plot the ROC curve comparison between the SGD classifier and the Random Forest classifier, along with the annotated points for 90% recall, you can follow this code:

```python
recall_for_forest = tpr_forest[np.argmax(fpr_forest >= fpr_90)]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, "b:", linewidth=2, label="SGD")
plot_roc_curve(fpr_forest, tpr_forest, "Random Forest")
plt.plot([fpr_90, fpr_90], [0., recall_90_precision], "r:")
plt.plot([0.0, fpr_90], [recall_90_precision, recall_90_precision], "r:")
plt.plot([fpr_90], [recall_90_precision], "ro")
plt.plot([fpr_90, fpr_90], [0., recall_for_forest], "r:")
plt.plot([fpr_90], [recall_for_forest], "ro")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend(loc="lower right", fontsize=16)
save_fig("roc_curve_comparison_plot")
plt.show()
```

This will generate a ROC curve comparison plot with annotated points for 90% recall for both classifiers.

You can compute the ROC AUC score for the Random Forest classifier using the `roc_auc_score` function from `sklearn.metrics`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

roc_auc_score(y_train_5, y_scores_forest)
```

This will give you the ROC AUC score for the Random Forest classifier based on its predicted scores (`y_scores_forest`) and the true labels (`y_train_5`).

To calculate the precision score for the Random Forest classifier, you can use the `precision_score` function from `sklearn.metrics`:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

precision_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_forest)
```

This will compute the precision score based on the predicted labels (`y_train_pred_forest`) and the true labels (`y_train_5`).

To calculate the recall score for the Random Forest classifier, you can use the `recall_score` function from `sklearn.metrics`:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

recall_score(y_train_5, y_train_pred_forest)
```

This will compute the recall score based on the predicted labels (`y_train_pred_forest`) and the true labels (`y_train_5`).

You've fitted a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) on the first 1000 instances of the training set (`X_train[:1000]`, `y_train[:1000]`). Now, to predict whether `some_digit` represents a 5 or not using this trained classifier, you can use the `predict` method:

```python
svm_clf.predict([some_digit])
```

This will give you the prediction for `some_digit` based on the trained SVC model.

The `decision_function` method of the trained SVC model `svm_clf` provides the decision scores for each class for a given input sample. 

You can obtain the decision scores for `some_digit` by passing it as a parameter to the `decision_function` method:

```python
some_digit_scores = svm_clf.decision_function([some_digit])
some_digit_scores
```

This will return an array containing the decision scores for each class.

To find the class with the highest decision score for the input `some_digit`, you can use the `np.argmax` function to get the index of the maximum value in the `some_digit_scores` array. This index corresponds to the predicted class label.

```python
predicted_class = np.argmax(some_digit_scores)
predicted_class
```

The `svm_clf.classes_` attribute contains the list of classes detected by the SVM classifier. To access a specific class, such as class 5, you can index the `svm_clf.classes_` array.

```python
svm_classes = svm_clf.classes_
class_5 = svm_classes[5]
svm_classes, class_5
```

In the code snippet provided, you're using a One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy for multiclass classification with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This strategy involves training a separate binary classifier for each class, distinguishing it from all other classes. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```python
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Initialize the OneVsRestClassifier with an SVM classifier as the base estimator
ovr_clf = OneVsRestClassifier(SVC(gamma="auto", random_state=42))

# Train the OneVsRestClassifier on the first 1000 instances of the training data
ovr_clf.fit(X_train[:1000], y_train[:1000])

# Make a prediction for a single instance (some_digit)
ovr_clf.predict([some_digit])
```

In this code:

- `OneVsRestClassifier` is imported from `sklearn.multiclass`, providing a strategy to extend binary classifiers to multiclass classification.
- An SVM classifier is specified as the base estimator inside `OneVsRestClassifier`. This means that internally, it will create multiple SVM classifiers (one for each class) and train them accordingly.
- The `fit` method is called to train the OvR classifier on the first 1000 instances of the training data (`X_train[:1000]`, `y_train[:1000]`).
- Finally, the `predict` method is used to predict the class of a single instance, `some_digit`, using the trained OvR classifier.

The prediction will return an array indicating the predicted class label for the input instance according to the trained OvR classifier.

The `len(ovr_clf.estimators_)` expression returns the number of estimators (binary classifiers) used by the OneVsRestClassifier. Since this classifier is trained using a One-vs-Rest strategy, it creates one binary classifier for each class in the dataset.

Here's how you can interpret the result:

```python
len(ovr_clf.estimators_)
```

- `ovr_clf.estimators_` is an attribute of the `OneVsRestClassifier` object, which contains the list of binary classifiers created during training.
- `len()` is a Python function that returns the number of items in a list or any iterable object.

By evaluating `len(ovr_clf.estimators_)`, you'll get the number of binary classifiers, which is equal to the number of classes in the dataset. This value indicates how many binary classifiers were trained to handle the multiclass classification task. Each binary classifier is responsible for distinguishing one class from all other classes.

To train a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier using the `X_train` and `y_train` datasets and make predictions for a single instance `some_digit`, follow these steps:

1. **Train the classifier**: Use the following code to train the classifier:
    ```python
    sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

2. **Make predictions**: Predict the class label for the instance `some_digit` using the trained classifier:
    ```python
    predicted_label = sgd_clf.predict([some_digit])
    ```

Ensure that `X_train` contains the features of the training data and `y_train` contains the corresponding target labels. Similarly, `some_digit` should represent the features of the instance for which you want to make predictions.

To obtain the decision scores for a single instance `some_digit` using the trained SGD classifier (`sgd_clf`), you can use the `decision_function` method as follows:

```python
decision_scores = sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit])
```

This will give you the decision scores for the specified instance.

To perform cross-validation with the SGD classifier (`sgd_clf`) using the accuracy scoring metric, you can use the `cross_val_score` function from scikit-learn. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Perform cross-validation
accuracy_scores = cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train, cv=3, scoring="accuracy")

# Print the accuracy scores for each fold
print("Accuracy scores for each fold:", accuracy_scores)

# Calculate and print the mean accuracy score
print("Mean accuracy score:", accuracy_scores.mean())
```

This code will output the accuracy scores for each fold of cross-validation, as well as the mean accuracy score across all folds.

To perform cross-validation with the scaled training data using the SGD classifier (`sgd_clf`), you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Initialize the `StandardScaler`.
3. Scale the training data using the `fit_transform` method of the scaler.
4. Perform cross-validation with the scaled training data.

Here's the code:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Initialize the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Scale the training data
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train.astype(np.float64))

# Perform cross-validation with the scaled training data
accuracy_scores_scaled = cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=3, scoring="accuracy")

# Print the accuracy scores for each fold
print("Accuracy scores for each fold (scaled):", accuracy_scores_scaled)

# Calculate and print the mean accuracy score
print("Mean accuracy score (scaled):", accuracy_scores_scaled.mean())
```

This code will output the accuracy scores for each fold of cross-validation using the scaled training data, as well as the mean accuracy score across all folds.

To create a multi-label classifier using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm (`knn_clf`), you first need to define your target labels (`y_multilabel`). In this case, `y_multilabel` is created by combining two binary labels: one indicating whether the digit is large (7, 8, or 9), and the other indicating whether the digit is odd.

Here's the code:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np

# Define target labels for multi-label classification
y_train_large = (y_train >= 7)
y_train_odd = (y_train % 2 == 1)
y_multilabel = np.c_[y_train_large, y_train_odd]

# Initialize and train the K Nearest Neighbors classifier
knn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn_clf.fit(X_train, y_multilabel)
```

Now, `knn_clf` is trained on the features (`X_train`) and the multi-label target (`y_multilabel`). It can predict both whether a digit is large and whether it is odd simultaneously.

To predict the labels for a given digit using the trained `knn_clf` (K Nearest Neighbors classifier), you can use the `predict` method. This method will output an array indicating whether the predicted digit is large (7, 8, or 9) and whether it is odd.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
predicted_labels = knn_clf.predict([some_digit])
```

This will give you an array containing the predicted labels for `some_digit`. Each element in the array corresponds to one of the two labels: whether the digit is large and whether it is odd.

To compute the F1 score for the multilabel classification performed by the `knn_clf` model, you can use the `f1_score` function from scikit-learn. Since this is a multilabel classification, you should specify `average="macro"` to compute the F1 score for each label independently and then average the results.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Compute the F1 score
f1 = f1_score(y_multilabel, y_train_knn_pred, average="macro")
```

The `f1` variable will contain the F1 score for the multilabel classification.
